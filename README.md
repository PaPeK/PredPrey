# PredatorPrey â€“ simulation code for agent-based predator-prey interactions
Version 0.1 described and applied in <https://www.arxiv.org/content/??????MISSING??????>

(Python-wrapper package calling c++ running)

[Github](https://github.com/PaPeK/predatorPrey)

## General Notes

PredatorPrey is a C++ code which runs numerical simulations of the agent based stochastic differential equations.
The motivation of this code are group living animals, e.g. fish shoals in shallow water(2 dimensions).
In principle the code can be easily extended to three dimensions. However, the higher the dimension the smaller the volume if the number of agents stays constant.
For a full mathematical description of the stochastic differential equations and the social forces (repulsion, attraction and alignment) see <https://www.arxiv.org/content/??????MISSING??????>. 

## Required C++ libraries:

next to standard C libraries the following libraries need to be installed via ``apt-get install``'

- libhdf5-serial-dev
- libgsl-dev
- libcgal-dev

### Docker-alternative

The ```Dockerfile``` contains the build instruction for an image
which can be used to run the c++ code. In this case the above libraries do not need to be installed.
For building the docker:

- install docker following https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/.
- build the image by running 
```
docker build -t gcc_docker .
```
    in the directory of this git-repository
    - note that `gcc\_docker` is an arbitrary name for the image and can be chose freely
- check if the image exists by running `docker images` ("gcc_docker" should be listed)
- change in "RunSingle.py" the line `dockerName = None` to `dockerName = 'gcc_docker'`

## Required python packages

The code runs in the anaconda environment specified in `environment.yml` which can be created from the projects root directory via
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
which creates the environment `animateSwarm` (name specified in `environment.yml`) which you activate by
```shell
conda activate animateSwarm
```
In case you want to update your python packages to enable the code to run the most important packages are:

- numpy
- h5py
- matplotlib
- pathlib

## Compilation(MacOS/Linux):

On MacOS/Linux system:
The included Makefile is for compilation of the source code (see tutorial: http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/). Just run 

```
make
``` 

in the terminal in the directory of this repository.

#### Possible compilation problem

If you are using anaconda and h5py is installed the linking to the libhdf5-serial-dev library might not work.
A simple work around is to comment in your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.shrc` or `~/.zshrc` depending on the shell you are using) the anaconda initialization.
Than you start a new terminal and retry the compilation (run `make`).
If the compilation was succesfull you can uncomment the anaconda initialization again and run the python-scripts.

### Docker-alternative

run in the directory of this repository (assuming you followed the instructions above and called the docker image "gcc_docker" )

```
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp gcc_docker make
```

## Running

After successful compilation the executable file swarmdyn will be generated.
The executable is meant to be called via running:

```
python RunSingle.py
```


- RunSingle.py - starting a single simulation of swarmdyn and defining parameters.

RunSingle.py will also call a visualization of the simulations by calling:

- AnimateRun.py - animating the results using pythons matplotlib

### Docker-alternative

Remember to change in "RunSingle.py" the line `dockerName = None` to `dockerName = 'gcc_docker'` (or the docker-name you have chosen)
